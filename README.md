> handlers-helper was just fine with a single docs file! do we have to do this? UGH

handlers-helper was built with the principle of being so simple that lightweight document database for prototypes. However, as we grow, we need more structure.

> [!WARNING]
> These docs have been archived and are no longer updated! The docs have been moved to the [realtime-simple-Kotlin-optimize-rev-03](https://github.com/handlers-helper/realtime-simple-kotlin-optimize-rev-03) repository to keep a tighter connection between the codebase and documentation.
